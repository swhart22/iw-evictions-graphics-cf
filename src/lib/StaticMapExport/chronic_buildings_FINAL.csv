(13-64-190, 13-64-210) A carbon monoxide detector is needed whenever there is a heating appliance on the premises that burns fossil fuel such as gas, oil, or coal, or air that is circulated through a heat exchanger. Install according to manufacturer instructions. A hard wired model requires an electrical wiring permit. In a single family residence, be sure the detector is on or below the lowest floor with a place to sleep. In a multiple dwelling residence heated by a boiler, install a detector in the same room as the boiler. Otherwise, each apartment follows single family guidelines. The owner is responsible for installation and written instructions, the tenant for testing, maintenance, and batteries.","BL00331",2363374,"FAILED","N","COMPLAINT","SPECIAL TASK FORCE","604 E 75TH ST",604,"E","75TH","ST",51,41.758598682,-87.610030956,"(41.758598682034524, -87.6100309563656)","E 75TH ST","Y",2008
